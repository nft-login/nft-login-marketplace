## Inspiration

New games often are available as early access. In this phase the game finished, but a fan community can be build and the game designer get already an income.
NFTs are a good way to finance game development but also give the fans the ability to show up they founded the game.

## What it does

The marketplace allows game makers deploy contracts and mint NFT Tokens.
The fan community can buy the nft tokens then.

## How we built it

First we cloned a marketplace called crypto boys and modified it a little bit.
But in the end we decided to develop the smart contract from scratch.

## Challenges we ran into

Sometimes there were problems to get tokens from the faucets.
We needed the tokens to deploy the contract.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we deployed a erc721 smart contract, hosted a marketplace.

## What we learned

We learned to deploy smart contracts and how to host web3 software on github pages.

## What's next for the project

Next we need to give the frontend a redesign.
An extra contract should be created to list all games which provide NFTs.

## Built with

rust, web3, github-pages, react
