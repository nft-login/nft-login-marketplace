## Inspiration

New games often are available as early access. In this phase the game finished, but a fan community can be build and the game designer get already an income.
NFTs are a good way to finance game development but also give the fans the ability to show up they founded the game.

## What it does

The marketplace allows game makers deploy contracts and mint NFT Tokens.
The fan community can buy the nft tokens then.

The game hextris is not part of the hackathon and just embedded into our page.

## How we built it

First we cloned a marketplace called crypto boys and modified it a little bit.
But in the end we decided to develop the smart contract from scratch.

## Challenges we ran into

Sometimes there were problems to get tokens from the faucets.
We needed the tokens to deploy the contract.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we deployed a erc721 smart contract, hosted a marketplace.

## What we learned

We learned to deploy smart contracts and how to host web3 software on github pages.

## What's next for the project

Next we need to give the frontend a redesign.
An extra contract should be created to list all games which provide NFTs.

## Built with

rust, web3, github-pages, react

- imagine you are a game maker and your game is already beta
- why not give your fan community early access
- visit the early access nft marketplace
- add your game's name and a description in markdown
- select a price for the nft token
- now connect your metamask and deploy your nft contract
- gamers can now buy nft tokens for your game
- lets watch a demo where a gamers must buy a token to get access
- the gamer does not own a token so no access is granted
- but the gamer can visit the market and buy an nft
- now the gamer can login and enjoy the game
